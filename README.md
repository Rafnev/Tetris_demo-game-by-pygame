## üéØ Game Mechanics

### Piece Movement
- Pieces fall automatically based on the current level speed
- Manual controls allow horizontal movement and rotation
- Collision detection prevents invalid moves

### Line Clearing
- When a horizontal row is completely filled, it's cleared
- All blocks above the cleared line(s) fall down
- Multiple lines can be cleared simultaneously for bonus points

### Game Over
- Game ends when newly spawned pieces overlap with existing blocks
- Final score, level, and lines cleared are displayed

## üîß Customization

Want to modify the game? Here are some easy tweaks:

### Change Colors
Edit the `COLORS` list in the code:
```python
COLORS = [
    (0, 255, 255),    # I - Cyan
    (0, 0, 255),      # J - Blue
    # ... modify as desired
]
```

### Adjust Difficulty
Modify the fall speed calculation:
```python
fall_speed = 0.5 - (level - 1) * 0.05  # Adjust multiplier for different difficulty
```

### Change Grid Size
Update the grid dimensions:
```python
GRID_WIDTH = 12   # Wider grid
GRID_HEIGHT = 22  # Taller grid
```
